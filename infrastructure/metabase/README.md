# OpenCRVS Dashboards

### Run in development mode

By default, Metabase is not started as part of the OpenCRVS stack as running it requires quite a bit of resources. You can use the following commands to use metabase in development:

`yarn metabase` – Starts Metabase in port http://localhost:4444
`yarn db:shell` - In the metabase directory – open a SQL shell for the database Metabase created

### Default credentials

These are the default credentials for logging in to Metabase

- Username: `user@opencrvs.org`
- Password: `m3tabase`
